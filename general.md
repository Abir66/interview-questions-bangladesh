# General Guidelines

### Projects and Thesis
For fresher roles almost all the companies ask about projects and thesis done in university. So, it is a good idea to take a refresher on them before going to the interview. 

### Resume
Instead of creating a resume from scratch by yourself, try using a template. You can find good tested templates on the web. If you just follow the basic template and change the information you get a pretty good starter. You can find a good latex resume template [here](https://github.com/arasgungore/arasgungore-CV). Follow the guidelines presented [here](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/technical-resume-tips) on how to write contents of a resume.

> [!TIP]
> Change your resume before applying to a new position tailoring for that specific role. It helps yourself to stand out from others

### Portfolio
You can't add everything to your resume. As it is better to keep resume as short as possible, many of the things need to be left out. So, it is a good choice to create a portfolio website. Add all your information there. Add a link of the portfolio to your resume. This way if your recruiter wants to know more about you, they can check the portfolio. For a simple and clean potfolio you can use this [portfolio generator](https://github.com/TamimEhsan/Simple-Portfolio-Generator) which builds a portfolio site from json files. 

### Linked In
Try to maintain a good linked in presence. Many companies post their vacancies in linked in. Keep your linkedin profile up to date. Sometimes recruiters directly reach out if they find the profile suitable for the role.

## Questions
<details>
<summary>
You are given a positive integer N. Find the number of triples (X,Y,Z) such that:

- 0 < X,Y,Z < N
- X + Y + Z = N
- X âˆ£âˆ£ Y âˆ£âˆ£ Z = N, where âˆ£âˆ£ represents the bitwise OR operation.
Since the number of triples can be huge, print them modulo 10^9+7.

You have a string of N decimal digits.

Now you are given M queries, each of whom is of following two types.

- Type 1: 1 X Y: Replace A[X] by Y.
- Type 2: 2 C D: Print the number of sub-strings divisible by 3 of the string denoted by A[C],A[C+1] ... A[D].
    Formally, you have to print the number of pairs (i,j) such that the string A[i],A[i+1]...A[j], (C â‰¤ i â‰¤ j â‰¤ D), when considered as a decimal number, is divisible by 3
